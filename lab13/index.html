<h1>Ashley Stewart's Biography</h1>

    <img src="../images/banner.png" alt="ashley in the dome" class="banner">
   <p>
       I grew up in Fairfax, Virginia. During my childhood I played soccer all the way through highschool. Now, I am a <strong>Sports Management major at Syracuse University</strong>, and I am interested in community relations or working in sports tech. 
   </p>

   <p>I am the current Vice President for Women in Sports and Events, I worked as a communications intern for Syracuse Athletics, and last summer I worked for a non-profit helping them to create a database comprised of council and committees with youth leadership.</p>

   <h2>Personal Information</h2>

   <p> Outside of work, I love to watch Washington Spirt. I will be studying abroad this spring semester, and I am excited to try new foods and to travel as much as possible.</p>
