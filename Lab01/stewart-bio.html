        I am a Sports Management major, and I am interesting in community relations or working in sports tech. I am the current Vice President for Women in Sports and Events, I worked as a communications intern for Syracuse Athletics, and last summer I worked for a non-profit helping them to create a database comprised of council and committees with youth leadership. Outside of work, I love to watch Washington Spirt. I will be studying abroad this spring semester, and I am excited to try new foods and to travel as much as possible.
