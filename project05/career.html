   <h2>Community Relations</h2>
   <img src="../images/stadium.jpg" alt="stadium">
   <p>Coming into Syracuse I thought I wanted to do marketing for a professional sports team. But after heavily exploring the sports industry and the different job opportunities it has, I have the goal to work in community relations. Either for a professional sports team or for a non-profit that work with sports.</p>
<div>
    <p>How I will Achieve My Goal:</p>
<div>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>I started to network with sport professional who work in community relations. I have met with Allie Gentle who is the Director of Community Relations at the Philadelphia Union. With our meetings I have asked her about her experience and what her day-to-day job looks like. I have gotten great advice and I even shadowed her at one of the Philadelphia Union community relations events.</li>
            <li>This semester, I am interning with 261 Fearless. A non-profit organization who empowers women through running and educational programs. 261 Fearless was founded by Kathrine Switzer who was the first woman to run the Boston Marathon. I will be working on their communications team helping with their social media, writing content, and anything that they throw at me. My biggest goal is to learn as much as possible. I want to have experience in every side of the business.</li>

        </ul>
