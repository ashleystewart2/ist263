   <h2>Community Relations</h2>
   <div class="top">
        <div class="top1">
             <p>Coming into Syracuse I thought I wanted to do marketing for a professional sports team. But after heavily exploring the sports industry and the different job opportunities it has, I have the goal to work in community relations. Either for a professional sports team or for a non-profit that work with sports.</p>
             <p> Growing up my family was very involved in volunteer work and non-profits. In high school I was a candidate for Leukemia and Lymphoma Society's Students of the Year. As a candidate I organized and lead a team of my peers to raise over $36,000. This experience taught me a lot about raising money, leadership, and team work. The reason why I specifically want to go into community relations in sports is because sport teams have big platforms that reach so many people. Sports has the power to spread awareness on causes and make significant change.</p>

    <h2>How I will Achieve My Goal:</h2>

    <p>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>I started to network with sport professional who work in community relations. I have met with Allie Gentle who is the Director of Community Relations at the Philadelphia Union. With our meetings I have asked her about her experience and what her day-to-day job looks like. I have gotten great advice and I even shadowed her at one of the Philadelphia Union community relations events.</li>
            <li>This semester, I am interning with 261 Fearless. A non-profit organization who empowers women through running and educational programs. 261 Fearless was founded by Kathrine Switzer who was the first woman to run the Boston Marathon. I will be working on their communications team helping with their social media, writing content, and anything that they throw at me. My biggest goal is to learn as much as possible. I want to have experience in every side of the business.</li>
